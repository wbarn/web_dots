=========

Here are a bunch of helpers for using with your BASH environment.

### .bash_profile
You can use this file as is by linking it into your home folder:
```
ln -s ~/cirro_dot/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
```

Or copy and paste items from within it into your own .bash_profile.


### .gitconfig
Helpful aliases as well as good settings.
Include in your ~/.gitconfig after the [user] block:
```
[include]
    path = ~/cirro_dot/gitconfig
```
